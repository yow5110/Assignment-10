# Week 13 Task 2

The emergency room wait time for 50 patients at a hospital is documented in "wait-time.dat". Read this sample into python using np.loadtxt with the appropriate arguments, and calculate the mean ( = a number), standard deviation (= a number), and the 95% confidence interval (= two numbers) of the wait time.
