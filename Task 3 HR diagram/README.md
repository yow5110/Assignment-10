# Week 13 Task 3

The Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram in astronomy is a useful tool in classifying stars and monitoring stellar evolution. In this task we'll create a lite version of it. Read the two columns of "hr.dat" data as temperatures and (normalized) luminosities of a selection of stasr. Following the convention of creating H-R diagrams, plot -log(temperautre) along x and log(normalized lumnosity) along y. A sample figure is attached.

The data points form clusters/strips - how many clusters/strips do you see? Can you name at least two features by comparing your plot with a more complete one on Wikpedia?
